description:
 Checks the output of '{sensors}' from the lm_sensors package.
 Note that configuration of alarms can (and should) be configured in the {sensors.conf} file that
 belongs to your lm_sensors installation.

examples:
 Setting the sensors: 
 For example if you have a lm85 chip, you can set the min fan speed of fan 2 by adding
 a line in {/etc/sensors.conf} like this:

  chip "lm85-*" "lm85b-*" "lm85c-*" "adm1027-*" "adt7463-*" "adt7468-*" "emc6d100-*" "emc6d102-*"
  set fan2_min 1000

 Or ignore specific checks like this:
  chip "lm85-*" "lm85b-*" "lm85c-*" "adm1027-*" "adt7463-*" "adt7468-*" "emc6d100-*" "emc6d102-*"
  ignore fan2

inventory:
 Each host which provides the section in the check_mk agent gets one Sensor_XXX service per reported sensor.
perfdata: 
 One variable: the current sensor value. This can be voltage, fan speed in rpm, temperature (either C or F), so
 make sure to set it to your desired format through sensors.conf
